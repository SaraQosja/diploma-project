Bachelor Thesis Project--Web based system for counseling high school students in career and academic orientation.
# Career Counseling Platform – MERN Stack

Career Counseling Platform is an online platform designed to help high-school students choose their future career path and university studies. The platform is based on a psychometric evaluation process using three core tests that assess students’ interests, abilities, and personal characteristics.

Test results are combined with academic grades to generate personalized career and study recommendations, providing data-driven guidance tailored to each student’s profile.

In addition to the recommendation system, the platform enables students to communicate with  counselors through a discussion forum and interact with an AI-powered chatbot for instant guidance and support.
The system is built using a full-stack MERN architecture, with Oracle Database used for relational data storage instead of MongoDB.
